Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging is a technique used in computational photography to capture both spatial and spectral information of a scene using a single image. It involves the use of a specialized coded aperture mask, which is placed in front of the camera lens. The coded aperture mask consists of a pattern of holes or slits that allow light to pass through. The pattern is designed in such a way that it introduces a unique modulation pattern into the captured image, which is dependent on the wavelength of the light. This allows for the separation of spectral information in the captured image. To capture an image using coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging, a scene is illuminated with a broadband light source. The light reflected or transmitted by the scene passes through the coded aperture mask and onto a sensor. The sensor records the modulated light patterns created by the coded aperture mask for different wavelengths. The captured image is then processed using computational algorithms to decode the spectral information. By solving an inverse problem, the original scene's spatial and spectral information can be recovered. Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging has several advantages over traditional spectrometers or multi-shot spectral imaging methods. It allows for a single snapshot capture, reducing capture time and enabling the capture of dynamic scenes. It also eliminates the need for moving parts or scanning mechanisms, making it more compact and robust. This technique finds applications in various fields such as remote sensing, biomedical imaging, and material analysis. It enables the acquisition of hyperspectral data in real-time, improving the efficiency and accuracy of spectral imaging systems.
